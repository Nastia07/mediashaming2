              Engine manufacturer Safran (part of the Thales group) employs 600 people in joint ventures across four
              sites in Russia, which accounts for half of its titanium supplies.
            </p>
            <p>
              The group has said that its current stocks will last "until next autumn".
            </p>
            <p>
              It does most of its business in Russia, to the tune of €300million per year (although this only accounts
              for 2% of its sales), as part of the regional Superjet 100 programme. It produces 20-25 aircraft a year,
              and supplies the engines, landing gear and propellers.
            </p>
            <p>
              A company owned by Thales and Safran also took advantage of Vladimir Putin’s appetite for military
              hardware to sell him infrared cameras. Sofradir signed a contract worth 5.2 million euros with Russia in
              October 2012. According to the 2016 classified SGDSN note cited earlier, Sofradir – a joint subsidiary of
              the two French defense groups – were still due to deliver “258 infrared detectors” to its Russian client.

          How the war is funded
        </h2>

        <div class="fundation__item">
          <div class="fundation__text">
            <p>
              In Russia, there is an autocratic regime of Vladimir Putin. All of Russia's biggest oligarchies, bankers,
              and manufacturers are his foothold. That is why they are sanctioned by the US and EU.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vladimir Putin uses every Russian manufactory, every dollar or euro of investments of every citizen of
              this
              country as a weapon to grow the military forces, depress the freedom of Russian citizens, commit war
              crimes,
              and encourage genocide of Ukrainians.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any big manufacturing or service industries in Russia are the support of Putin's regime. Supplying
              anything
              there (selling, providing services/technologies/investments), you become the same support for Putin's
              regime
              and collaborator of Putin's crimes.
            </p>
          </div>

              It's not a business as usual. Because there is no usual business in Russia. It's cooperation in a crime.
              Cooperation in killing Ukrainians who resist Putin's regime.
            </p>
            <p>
              Putin is not fighting with weapons by himself and not doing war crimes alone. Any russian factory that
              produces tanks which shoot peaceful Ukrainian houses or rockets which bomb refugees at train stations,
              needs deliveries from hundreds of US and EU factories for continuing activities. Without these supplies,
              the factory can't produce a tank, a rocket or a bomb. Someone is making machines for Putin, someone -
              microcircuits, someone delivers raw materials, someone - payment methods, and someone is paying for the
              raw materials with money.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="fundation__item">
          <div class="fundation__text">
            <p>
              Ukrainians are dying while trying to stop a russian tank and hide their children from rockets. But russian
              tank can be stopped in another way, so the same as russian rocket to stop flying. Russian tank can just
              not ride out of the factory. And what's even better is not to let this factory function and not let Putin
              have the opportunity to pay for this tank or rocket.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ukrainians are begging for peace, sympathy, and asking for your help. Business with Russia leads a company
              to become a cooperator of Putin's crimes. Dear “company name”, don't cooperate with Putin. Save Ukraine
              from the war and Ukrainian children from deaths.

            Ukrainians won't forget their murderers and will remember all of them, similar to how Jewish remembered all
            the followers of Hitler who made the Holocaust. Ukrainians won't also forget Putin's collaborators in these

            Ukrainians bravely protect their towns from the dictator who threatens the world with nuclear war. Does the

          <p>
            Every russian rocket was built and paid for through the technologies of foreign companies. Now, when these
