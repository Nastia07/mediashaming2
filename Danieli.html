              <p>
                The Italian international industrial company, Danieli, is one of the three largest suppliers of
                equipment
                for the metalworking industry in the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Danieli firm produces machinery for metallurgical plants, including blast furnaces, rolling mills
                for
                continuous casting of hot and cold metal products, cutting tools, and devices for automating the
                metallurgical
                process at every level.
              </p>
              <p>
                30 percent of the company's global revenue is generated in Russia. There are service centers for Danieli
                in Magnitogorsk,
                Chelyabinsk, Vyksa, Dzerzhynsk, and Novokuznetsk in addition to the company's head office in Moscow. The
                company's
                presence is not geographically random. Large Russian industrial plants, Danielш's clients, are situated
                in these cities.
                In Russia, a specialized manufacturing called "Danieli Volga" is also in operation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Formally, Danieli's clients do not belong to the military-industrial complex. However, they are the main
                suppliers of raw materials (for example, special types of steel) to Russian military industrial complex
                enterprises that manufacture weapons.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yes, it is difficult to categorically label Danieli's machines as those having a military purpose.
                However, Russia uses Danieli’s equipment to make tank armor, nuclear reactor hulls on nuclear
                submarines, elements of salvo-fire systems, and more.
              </p>
              <b>
                The most important thing is that, even after Russia started a bloody war in Europe, Danieli did not
                refuse to cooperate with the aggressor. Of course, if someone sells lemons, then what difference does it
                make to him or her, who will drink lemonade squeezed from them. However, does this mean that it is worth
                selling lemons to a concentration camp?
              </b>
              <h3>What do Danielі's Russian clients do?</h3>
              <p>
                Danieli works with the major players in the Russian metallurgical industry. Some of them are owned by
                Vladimir Putin-connected Russian oligarchs who have been sanctioned. The great majority collaborates
                with businesses in the Russian defense sector and takes part in the direct production of weapons for the
                Russian military.
              </p>
              <h3>JSC "Corporation Krasny Oktyabr"</h3>
              <p>
                The Krasny Oktyabr metallurgical plant is one of the largest Russian producers of special grades of
                steel used for military purposes. The owner of the plant, Dmitri Pumpiansky, has been under EU and US
                sanctions since March 9, 2022.
              </p>
              <p>
                Krasny Oktyabr supplies its own products to the only tank manufacturer in Russia - Uralvagonzavod. The
                latter uses it for the armor of the T-14 "Armata" tank. The United Aircraft Corporation, which makes
                SU-57 fighters, also buys steel from Krasny Oktyabr. The steel produced by Krasny Oktyabr is used in the
                production of nuclear reactor hulls that power Russian nuclear submarines.
              </p>
              <p>
                In April 2022, the head of JSC "Corporation Krasny Oktyabr" Konstantin Volkov stated that Danieli
                continued cooperation with the plant. "We had concerns about continuing cooperation with Danieli's
                company. However, our partners have decided to continue working together and we have already received an
                offer from them for the purchase of spare parts and are waiting for a contract to launch the PN-370
                machine," said Volkov.
              </p>
              <p>
                Indeed, even two months after the war started by Russia, Danieli continues to supply equipment to the
                aggressor country. This equipment, in particular, produces special grades of steel and metallurgical
                products, which are then used for the production of fighter jets, nuclear submarines and tanks by the
                enterprises of the Russian military industry.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="hero__info_text">
              <h3>Severstal</h3>
              <p>The “Severstal” plant supplies more than ten grades of steel to enterprises of the Russian defense
                industry. In order to be able to produce it, "Severstal" buys machine tools from Danieli and orders the
                modernization of steel vacuuming technologies at all stages - from project development to supply,
                installation and maintenance of equipment. Do you know what the future fate of the steel produced under
                Danieli's technological supervision is? It is used in the construction of new submarines and ships for
                the Russian Navy, armored personnel carriers and other light armored vehicles, salvo-fire systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                Special hull steel from "Severstal" is used for the construction of submarines of project 955A
                ("BoreyA") and project 885 ("Yasen"). Also, “Severstal” is a supplier of special steel for the
                construction of a series of small missile ships of project 21631: "Grad Sviyazhsk", "Uglich", "Zelenyi
                dol", "Serpukhov", "Vyshniy Volochok" and "Velikiy Ustyug".
              </p>
              <h3>Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works (abbreviated as MMK)</h3>
              <p>
                The Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works is seen in cooperation with KAMAZ PJSC, which belongs to Rostec
                State Corporation. The enterprise produces military equipment, in particular KamAZ-63968 or "Typhoon-K".
                The owner of MMK Viktor Rashnikov is under EU sanctions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Shortly before the Russian invasion, on January 18, 2022, Danieli entered into an agreement with MMK to
                build four new heating furnaces. The first of them should be commissioned in 2023, and the last - in
                2026.
              </p>
              <h3>Ural Mining and Metallurgical Company (UMMC)</h3>
              <p>
                UMMC Holding, which is a Danieli's partner, owns the Czech company Aircraft Industries. Four
                transport-passenger aircraft L-410UVPE20 manufactured by Aircraft Industries were handed over to the
                Aviation Regiment of the Central Military District of Russia.
              </p>
              <h3>Kamensk-Uralsky Metallurgical Works J.S.Co. (KUMZ)</h3>
              <p>
                KUMZ supplies aluminum parts for both civil and military Russian aircraft, including the Superjet,
                IL-96, Tu-204/214, Su and MiG class aircraft.
              </p>
              <h3>Zlatoust Metallurgical Plant (ZMZ)</h3>
              <p> Danieli started working with the Zlatoust Metallurgical Plant in 2020. From April 2022, ZMZ products
                are
                being supplied to Nizhny Novgorod 70th Anniversary Of Victory Plant
                (JSC Concern VKO "Almaz-Antey") as part of the import substitution program, which manufactures equipment
                for the extraction of hydrocarbons to the order of PJSC "Gazprom", as well as to leading oil and gas
                production companies and oil service enterprises, such as Sibur PJSC, Lukoil PJSC, Transneft PJSC, etc.
              </p>

              <p>No retreat from the Russian market, cancellation of investments or new projects, restriction of
                business
                operations, or other reduction in presence in Russia have been announced by Danieli. Additionally, the
                business keeps on hiring people in Russia.</p>

              <p> On June 15, 2022, a meeting of representatives of the Italian company Danieli with representatives of
                the
                St. Petersburg business community took place at the Center for the Development and Support of
                Entrepreneurship. They discussed a number of issues related to production at Russian sites, including
                new
                supply chains.</p>

              <p> It's interesting to note that during the 2022 economic forum in St. Petersburg, the program of the
                Chechen
                delegation on behalf of Ramzan Kadyrov planned to sign a number of important agreements and hold
                meetings
                with the President of the Danieli company in Russia.</p>

              <b>Do any of you Danieli gentlemen even know who Kadyrov is? THE WORST THING IS THAT YOU DO.</b>

          How the war is funded
        </h2>

            <p>
              In Russia, Vladimir Putin has built an autocratic regime. He uses all the oligarchs, bankers, and large
              manufacturers as a foothold. That is why the US and EU sanctioned most of them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vladimir Putin uses every Russian manufactory, every dollar or euro of investments, and every ruble paid
              as a tax in Russia as means to grow the military force, depress the freedom of Russian citizens, commit
              war crimes, and encourage genocide of Ukrainians.
            </p>
            <p>
              Any big manufacturing or service industry in Russia is automatically supporting Putin's regime. Supplying
              anything to Russia, whether it is services, technologies, or investments, you invest in Putin's military
              power and fuel Putin's war machine with your money.
            </p>
          </div>

              It's not just a business. Because there is no usual business in Russia anymore. Since Russia is
              responsible for the war in Ukraine, cooperating with Russia means joining the crime. It means cooperating
              with Russia in killing Ukrainians who resist Putin's regime.
            </p>
            <p>
              Putin is not fighting with weapons by himself and not doing war crimes alone. All the Russian factories
              that produce tanks that shoot peaceful Ukrainian houses or missiles that shell refugees at train stations
              require supplies from US and EU factories to continue their activities. Without these supplies, the
              factories cannot manufacture tanks, missiles, and war machines. Supporting Putin’s war can have many
              shapes: it can be selling microcircuits to middle-size Russian companies, delivering raw materials that
              can be later sold to other companies, or even simply paying money for any Russian goods or services.

            <p>
              Ukrainians are dying while trying to stop Russian tanks and hide their children from Russian missiles. But
              Russian tanks and missiles can be stopped in another way. It is possible to make the Russian tanks stay
              unused or unassembled at the factory. Or, even better, to make such a Russian factory stop completely or
              to make it impossible for Putin to pay for tanks and missiles.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ukrainians are begging for peace, sympathy, and asking for your help. Doing business with Russia while it
              still wages the war makes a company a Putin's criminal partner. Dear Danieli, don't cooperate with
              Putin. Save Ukraine from the war. Save Ukrainian children and help them stay alive.

                In Russia, there are no independent businesses. Russia is a system of oligarchs and law enforcement that
                cover up tyranny and one another. As a result, nearly all Russian oligarchs are subject to EU and US
                sanctions. Cooperation with them and their companies entails cooperation with Putin’s regime and
                maintaining its viability.
              </li>
              <li>
                Purchasing resources in Russia is a direct investment in war. Any company doing business in Russia and
                paying taxes to the Russian government is funding the war.

                destroying schools, maternity hospitals, and residential buildings in Ukraine.
